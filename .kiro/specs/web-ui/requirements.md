# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a dynamic web user interface to the existing MCP Jungle application, providing an easy-to-use web interface that uses polling for near real-time updates. The web UI will be built using a CDN-based frontend framework to avoid server-side build dependencies, making it lightweight and easy to deploy.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access a web interface for MCP Jungle, so that I can manage MCP servers and tools through a browser instead of using CLI commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the web interface THEN the system SHALL display a responsive web application
2. WHEN the web application loads THEN the system SHALL use a CDN-based frontend framework without requiring server-side build processes
3. WHEN the user accesses the interface THEN the system SHALL provide the same core functionality available through the CLI

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time updates in the web interface, so that I can see changes to MCP servers and tools without manually refreshing the page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MCP server status changes THEN the system SHALL push updates to the web interface using Server-Sent Events
2. WHEN new tools are registered or deregistered THEN the system SHALL automatically update the web interface
3. WHEN multiple users are connected THEN the system SHALL broadcast updates to all connected clients

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage MCP servers through the web interface, so that I can register, start, stop, and configure servers without using CLI commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the servers page THEN the system SHALL display all registered MCP servers with their current status
2. WHEN a user clicks "register server" THEN the system SHALL provide a form to add new MCP servers
3. WHEN a user submits server registration THEN the system SHALL validate the configuration and register the server
4. WHEN a user clicks "start server" THEN the system SHALL start the selected MCP server and update the status
5. WHEN a user clicks "stop server" THEN the system SHALL stop the selected MCP server and update the status
6. WHEN a user clicks "delete server" THEN the system SHALL deregister the server after confirmation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to browse and invoke MCP tools through the web interface, so that I can test and use tools interactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the tools page THEN the system SHALL display all available tools from registered servers
2. WHEN a user selects a tool THEN the system SHALL display the tool's schema and input parameters
3. WHEN a user fills out tool parameters and clicks "invoke" THEN the system SHALL execute the tool and display results
4. WHEN tool execution is in progress THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator
5. WHEN tool execution completes THEN the system SHALL display the results in a readable format

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view system configuration and status, so that I can monitor the health and configuration of the MCP Jungle system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display system overview including server count and status
2. WHEN a user views configuration THEN the system SHALL display current system settings
3. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL display error notifications in the web interface
4. WHEN the user requests system information THEN the system SHALL display version and runtime details

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the web UI to be deployable without build dependencies, so that it can be easily integrated and deployed with the existing Go application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL serve static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
2. WHEN serving frontend assets THEN the system SHALL use CDN-based frameworks and libraries
3. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL NOT require Node.js, npm, or other frontend build tools
4. WHEN the web server starts THEN the system SHALL serve the web interface on a configurable port

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the web interface to be responsive and accessible, so that I can use it effectively on different devices and screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the interface on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a mobile-optimized layout
2. WHEN accessing the interface on desktop THEN the system SHALL utilize available screen space effectively
3. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL support standard accessibility patterns
4. WHEN screen readers are used THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and semantic markup
